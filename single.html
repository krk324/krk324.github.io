                                <h1>Overview</h1>
                                <p>Cryptocurrency/Blockchain are the next promising technology with a potential to innovate how we transfer a value just as the internet enables people to transfer information instantly. Word blockchain has been a buzzword and many apps that use this new tech have emerged. However, most apps UI/UX designs are unintuitive. While core service development is the highest priority for early-stage cutting-edge technology like blockchain, I believe implementation of design methods will help improve the overall accessibility and service quality which opens up the doors to non-technical users for mass adoption. This article will look into UI/UX of Abra, one of the popular and oldest apps in the States. I hope this article will help contribute to raising the baseline of app/web design in blockchain/cryptocurrency industry.  </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h1>Objectives</h1>
                                <p>To explore the human-centered design process by evaluating the usability of apps. I chose to do a case study on Abra. Abra is cryptocurrency wallet and exchange intent to be the simplest place to invest in cryptocurrency. I am not affiliated with Abra. I am just looking for ways to challenge myself as a designer.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h1>Problem & Hypothesis</h1>
                                <p>While working in crypto/blockchain industry for over 3+ years I realized there are many unintuitive apps that are difficult to use. Abra is one of those apps I’ve been following since the inception. As I had difficulties buying coins using the Abra’s app, I assumed other users also have same issues. Through this UX case study, I hope to help pursue Abra’s mission statement “cryptocurrency investing simplified.”</p>

                                <h2>Proto-Persona</h2>
                                <p>As a starting point, I created a proto-persona based on my own experience I had at cryptocurrency exchange company and by conducting a brief online interview with my friends who have invested in cryptocurrency before.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2>Scenarios</h2>
                                <p>I created the following scenarios and job story to prepare for the usability test.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <strong>Ryan buys cryptocurrency.</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1) Ryan heard about new promising cryptocurrency from his friend he trust.</li>
                                    <li>2) Ryan opens the app and searches and finds the new cryptocurrency. After doing a simple research he decides to buy.</li>
                                    <li>3) Ryan realized he needs to add money to his account, so he adds money.</li>
                                    <li>4) Ryan buys new cryptocurrency</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2>Job Story</h2>
                                <p>When my friend I can trust ping me a notice about new promising cryptocurrency, I want to learn about it and buy it, so I can own it and increase my savings when the price goes up.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2>Guerrilla Usability Testing</h2>
                                <p>Over two days I’ve tested 7 strangers at blockchain related events and cafe in San Francisco. Based on my persona, I checked if they qualify as test users. Following is a simple user demographic of our test users. </p>
                                <p>3/7 Have purchased cryptocurrency before.</p>
                                <p>5/7 Use apps like acorn and Robinhood to invest.</p>
                                <p>After validating test users, based on scenarios and job story I conducted a guerrilla usability testing. Before the tests, I asked all the participants to imagine the following scenario.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Scenario: Your friend you can trust recommended you to buy Ethereum. You are considering buying Ethereum.</p>
                                <p>All participants were given the following tasks:</p>
                                <ui>
                                    <li>How do you check the price of ETH?</li>
                                    <li>How will you add new cryptocurrency to the home screen?</li>
                                    <li>Let say you decided to buy ETH. If you want to add money to your account how will you do that?</li>
                                    <li>Now you have a balance in your account, how will you buy $5 worth of ETH?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h1>Analysis - Identify and prioritize pain points</h1>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2>Affinity mapping</h2>
                                <p>I categorized the results of user interviews by pain points using a spreadsheet. Following are the analyzed key results.</p>
                                <ul>                                
                                    <li>7/7 users I tested had difficulties buying a crypto where some user gave up on the app in the middle of the test. </li>
                                    <li>6/7 users had difficulties checking the price of cryptocurrencies.</li>
                                    <li>5/7 users had difficulties going back to the home screen. They couldn’t identify the button portfolio on the right-hand corner that direct them to the home screen.</li>
                                    <li>4/7 had difficulties adding new coins to their portfolio.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h1>2x2 Matrix</h1>
                                <p>After categorizing the pain points I prioritized them using 2x2 matrix. As a result, I decided to focus on the improvement of features that relates to buying and selling. </p>
                                <p>Business Goals: Direct users to buy and sell many cryptocurrencies as possible.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>I created a task flow to identify at which point users are struggling to buy cryptocurrency.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>I sketched out Lo-fi mockups to explored the best possible solutions that solve identified pain points. </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h1>Hi-fi Design & Prototyping</h2>
                                <p>After exploring Lo-fi mockups I used Sketch to create Hi-fi mockups and working prototype to test my solution with users. Following are the changes I made to the app. </p>
